Intro

"My name is Trudy Doo and you're an idiot if you trust me. 
I'm thirty two and it's too late for me. I'm lost. I'm stuck 
in the old way of thinking. I still take my freedom for granted 
and let other people take it away from me. You're the first 
generation to grow up in Gulag America, and you know what 
your freedom is worth to the last goddamned cent!"
